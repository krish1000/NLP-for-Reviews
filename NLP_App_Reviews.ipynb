        "From an overlook Vader seems to be more accurate in comparison to Textblob. Just taking a quick glance at the values we see that Textblob has less tolerance (less weight) and gives out 1s and -1s often when it sees an obvious positive or negative. Whereas Vader has more tolerance (more weight) when it depicts sentiments thus in that sense Vader can be used to distinguish reviews and Textblob can be used to identify the obvious positive or negative sentiments.\n",
        "<br><br>\n",
        "To interpret the simalrity or difference one must compare the same text input and look at the polarity sentiment values. In terms of similarity both ranges values between -1 being negative and +1 being positive sentiment. The difference being Vader also gives seperate values on positive, negative and neutral which can be useful when it comes to distinguish similar sentiments, i.e comparing 2 positive sentiments to see which one has a more positive polarity to it. Whereas TextBlob is more likely to get 1 to both if they are an obvious positive statement, i.e in the above reviews TextBlob gave 'app give best protection computer help never problem android dont go life without' a polarity of 1 and also gave 1 to 'best'. Whereas Vader gave 0.8465 to the first review, and 0.6369 for 'best'.\n",
        "<br><br>\n",
        "Thus, we can see that Vader is the better option for reviewing the comments. Reason being, it attempts to be more accurate by differianting positive reviews i.e in the above example the more descriptive and positive toning one had a higher score than the simple review, 'best'. This can be useful when it comes to figuring out which reviews to take a look at for eliciting requirements, i.e lower (negative) or higher (positive) scores are typically descriptive and provides a good tone to take a look at. Wheras Textblob might be useful when it comes to having a quick glance on how well an app is doing."

So it was particulary difficult to find 10 reviews that the developer needs to take care of with. But what was interesting to find is majority of the reviews listed below have the same dominant topic which was #7, it seems like this topic is more related to negative type reviews or to criticize.<br> \n",
        "The topic has the keywords: `one, thing, easy, app, quick, use, like, star, great, working` <br>\n",
        "And these keywords are synonymous with negative reviews due to haveing key words that can be used in terms of e.g \"one star\", not \"working\", hard to \"use\" etc.\n",
        "<br><br>\n",
        "List of 10 reviews that I believe developers should take care of with are listed below (provided table row number along with dominant topic, and percentage):<br><br>\n",
        "11\t7.0\t0.8897  would give zero star id could<br>\n",
        "The logic that was used to choose this review as this was the only blatant review stating their hatred towards the app without stating a reason as to why. The developer(s) can further engage with this user by replying what caused them to wanting to rate the app as a 0 star. By doing so they can figure out where to improve the app inorder to increase satisfaction from its user base.\n",
        "<br><br>\n",
        "38\t9.0\t0.9544  compared apps space theyre given 860kb featureless app going get five star dev want look competition uninstalling<br>\n",
        "This user wants a root verifying app to take less space on their phone. As such the developer(s) should attempt to make the app gradle files take up less space as more space can cause disatisfaction to users who care about their phone memory. The developer can either attempt to shorten code etc. without losing features or create a seperate product line i. a lite version of the app, similar to what Facebook did with the messenger app, created a lite messenger app to take up far less space.\n",
        "<br><br>\n",
        "49\t7.0\t0.8774\twant something root tab please actually never rooted device one star isnt app thanks <br>\n",
        "The developers should clearly state that their app is only meant to verify root as some users might not understand, this can be done by improving UI and/or improving app description.\n",
        "<br><br>\n",
        "50\t7.0\t0.9411\tkeep simple stupid old bloke like retired ncr still making mainframe right <br>\n",
        "This review wants the app to be 'simple', reason why I chose this is so developers can try to improve the UI (i.e usability of the app). This can also been as a way for developer(s) can improve their app by having a section in which they educate how rooting works etc.\n",
        "<br><br>\n",

        "This review is very important as its one of the reviews they are trying to give a suggestion to a new feature or improvement to the developer. Following reviews such as these that are within the scope of the project/product can be very beneficial to keep user satisfaction/\n",

        "72\t5.0\t0.7965\tcant open file <br>\n",
        "Bug issue, developer can request their android version and device and attempt to fix it for user satisfaction.\n",

        "Another bug issue in which the app was stuck on welcome screen and they couldn't figure out how to verify root privileges. This can either be a bug or UI is difficult to understand, this is important to the developer(s) as it can allow for improvement to their ui or figure out an bug case to increase user satisfaction.\n",

        "This seems like an extensive bug report. Given that there's so many bug reports the developers should also look into ways of creating a feedback system within the app, or clearly stating where to contact within the app (i.e email of sorts).\n",

From the 10 reviews I listed above (bonus task 4) we clearly see that nearly half of the reviews are bug reports and suggestions. By having a simple form system can provide a mutual benefits to both the users and the developers. Rather than having a flood of 1 star reviews for bug reports, users can easily send reviews through in-app and developer's app page will not get a lower rating as well as all the bug reports will be in a single spot. This allows developers to spend less time to manually go through the reviews to find bug reports. Likewise with suggestions, all new user suggestions can easily be organized through a form system and developers can easily prioritize which suggestions to implement with (assuming its under the scope of the app).<br>\n",

So instead they should have a section in which it educates the users on how rooting a device works and explicitly stating device details on how the current device is not rooted.
